<html><body><h1>Chapter 2: The Beautiful Eunuch</h1><h2>I</h2><p>“Huh... is that so?”</p><p>It was the evening of the day that the emperor had first appeared before his concubines. Upon returning to her room, Rimi had found a piece of paper, upon which a good number of unfamiliar words were written. After spending a while decoding the message, putting to good use a self-made glossary that the Wakokuan interpreter had entrusted her with, she was finally able to understand what it said.</p><p>“‘You lowly, foreign woman. You filthy prostitute. Having your head cut off by His Majesty’s holy sword would be a fitting end for someone like you,’ I believe, or something to that effect.” She read it out loud, with a mixed sense of achievement and disappointment. The message consisted almost completely of dirty slang words. Words like these would not be found in a normal Konkokuan book, so the interpreter’s glossary had come in handy.</p><p>When the interpreter handed Rimi the glossary, he had said, “I’m sure this will be of good use to you.” Rimi figured that he must have been a rather shrewd individual with a good idea of what the rear palace of Konkoku was like.</p><p>Before Rimi joined the rear palace, she had envisioned what life here might be like. Her predictions had turned out to be alarmingly accurate. She may have been just one concubine among 120, but as people gossiped about the princess from Wakoku, it had become difficult <em>not</em> to stand out. Not to mention, it was obvious that Rimi had no intimidating people backing her and her rank was a mere Lady of Precious Bevy—a palace woman. For both Noble Consort So and whoever threw this piece of paper into Rimi’s room, Rimi was the perfect target for belittlement and stress relief.</p><p>For Rimi, who was used to living like a bird in a cage, even harassment could be entertaining, as long as there was some amount of unpredictability to it, or if there were discoveries that could be made. However, so far the unpredictability had been nonexistent.</p><p>“Though I suppose overly creative bullying would be a pain in its own way,” Rimi muttered. She held the paper up against the fire of a candle to burn it, stood up from her desk, and sat down by the table. Her supper, which the old handmaid had brought her a moment ago, was sitting on the table, soft steam rising from it. The meal consisted of stir-fried vegetables and meat covered in a thick sauce with a sweet and sour scent. Rimi picked up her chopsticks and started eating.</p><p>She took one bite, then another. However, she soon put her chopsticks down again and sighed.</p><p>“I still can’t taste anything... Is something wrong with me? I don’t get it...” She was completely unable to taste the food, and not only this meal—all food she had eaten since she joined the rear palace had tasted like nothing to her. Something was strange with her sense of taste.</p><p>She had been almost wholly unaware of her feelings of loneliness and carefree demeanor. Whenever any such feelings were close to surfacing, she would force them back down. However, in the end, she was only human, and deep down, those feelings had been growing steadily. Perhaps this was what had caused her failing sense of taste. <em>Who knew that even I, who always got scolded by Lady Saigu for my carefree demeanor, could end up like this.</em></p><p>She had been looking forward to seeing what Konkokuan food was like, but how was she supposed to enjoy this foreign cuisine when she was unable to even taste it? And worst of all, with her sense of taste gone, she was unable to exert her one redeeming feature—her skill as a cook.</p><p>“Well, not that there’s anyone here to eat what I make anyway...”</p><p>Feeling miserable, in part from her loneliness from having come to a foreign country all by herself, and in part from how uncomfortable she was feeling where she had now found herself, she let out a deep sigh. The chair she was sitting in, the room she was in, everything felt so distant to her, as if they were refusing to accept her.</p><p>“It seems I’m without a place in the world once again. After all, there’s no Lady Saigu here to enjoy the food I make.” Though she was making sure not to speak Wakokuan out loud, she felt no closer to fitting in at Konkoku.</p><p><em>No, this won’t do. I have to make the best of my situation. Oh yes, I know!</em> She pushed away the feelings bubbling up in her chest, put her chopsticks on the table, stood up, and headed to her bedroom.</p><p>On that night three days ago, when Rimi had first noticed that something was wrong with her sense of taste, she had attempted a certain experiment. She had grabbed the small terracotta pot standing in the corner of the room that she’d brought with her from Wakoku. As she had opened the lid, a pleasant smell had risen from the pot—the sweet, rich fragrance reminiscent of rice wine.</p><p>“What a lovely, mellow scent.” She had filled her lungs with the smell, then had put her hands into the pot and felt around. From the thick, glossy, and white pickling bed, she had pulled out a small spring melon split in two. It had lost a slight amount of water, but its light green color, reminiscent of fine jade, was still intact. Rimi had wrapped the melon in paper and headed to the kitchen on light feet.</p><p>The servants who were working in the kitchen had seemed surprised at Rimi’s sudden appearance. The kitchen was not a place usually frequented by high-ranking palace women. However, when Rimi had politely asked them to cut the melon into thin pieces, they had skillfully complied. She had placed the thin pieces of jade-colored melon on a small porcelain plate and returned to her residence. She had pushed aside the food on the table, taken a piece of melon from the porcelain plate, and put it in her mouth.</p><p>She could sense the faint, sweet scent of rice wine, as she had bit down on the familiar, crunchy yet soft melon. She then took a sip of hot water. As the water slid down her throat, she could smell a pleasing scent, and suddenly even the hot water seemed to taste good.</p><p>“I can taste this.” Rimi had blinked a few times in surprise, after which a relieved smile emerged on her face, and she had put another slice in her mouth. Having been unable to taste anything as of late, the ability to enjoy this taste had calmed her mind.</p><p>Rimi liked to eat. As long as she could eat to her heart’s content, no matter how miserable a situation she found herself in, she never felt miserable herself. As long as her stomach swelled, she could feel a warm power well up from within her. Perhaps this was an animal instinct.</p><p>“Wait, could it be...” An idea had come to her, and she had reached out her hand to try a bite of the Konkokuan food. As she did, a faint taste of salt filled her mouth.</p><p><em>It seems that if I eat kaorizuke, my sense of taste comes back, if only a little. If I eat kaorizuke every day from now on, perhaps I’ll be able to taste food properly at some point.</em> She had felt relieved at the possibility. Right now, Rimi had no one to cook for. However, as long as her sense of taste came back, she would be able to make food, and things wouldn’t seem so bleak.</p><p>At seven years of age, Rimi had managed to find a place for herself with the help of cooking. <em>It must be possible to do the same here in Konkoku,</em> she thought. Her optimism came from the pillar supporting her, a pillar she had spent ten long years as an Umashi-no-Miya constructing. As long as she had that pillar, Rimi could feel at ease.</p><p>Perhaps one day, someone would appear before Rimi to eat and enjoy the food she made. If her sense of taste did not work then, it would all be for naught. Rimi could not be without her sense of taste. Thus, she would have to put the kaorizuke to good use.</p><p>She felt immense gratitude toward the man who had been kind to her the day she first entered the rear palace, who had ensured that she did not have to part with her kaoridoko. He was still the only person in Konkoku who had been kind to her.</p><p><em>I wish I could see him again.</em> She somehow missed that man, whose name she did not even know.</p><p>“If you aren’t eating your food, I will remove it,” the old handmaid who had just entered said irritably, reaching out toward the plate. She then noticed the porcelain plate near Rimi and made an expression like she had just spotted an insect. “What in the world is that?”</p><p>“Would you like some? I made it with that pot.”</p><p>“Oh, dear heavens, no. I heard you brought a pot containing an unknown substance with you upon entering the rear palace, enraging the eunuchs.”</p><p>“But I did get permission. How sad that you aren’t having any. Eating this is good for your skin, you know.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>The old handmaid had instinctively reached out for the melon, but Rimi had just put the last piece in her mouth. Rimi apologized with an “Oh, I’m sorry,” but the handmaid only stared back at her bitterly.</p><p>“If nothing else, your skin certainly is beautiful, Lady Rimi. But I can’t imagine that eating something like that would be good for your skin.”</p><p>Rimi had been given the family name Setsu, meaning snow. From what she had heard, the name came from how fair her skin was. And her skin was indeed beautiful. Her fine cheeks were smooth, yet bouncy—reminiscent of soft, smooth mochi.</p><p>It was said that eating kaorizuke made your skin beautiful, thanks to the spirits that lived in the kaoridoko cleansing your body. As your body is cleansed by the spirits, the effects gradually show on your skin. As the spirits disliked fire, they would disappear if the kaoridoko was heated.</p><p>“Don’t break the pot. If you do, I might kill you a bit.”</p><p>“K-Kill me?!”</p><p>“Oh, is ‘kill’ wrong? Um... was it ‘whack,’ maybe...?” She was trying to say that if the handmaid broke the pot, Rimi might not be able to forgive her, but apparently, she had used the wrong word.</p><p>“I say, do stop with those frightening threats. Not to worry, considering Master Shusei gave you permission, I shan’t throw it away.”</p><p>Rimi had jumped up from her chair as she heard what the old handmaid said and hurriedly asked her for clarification.</p><p>“Wait, what was that? What did you just say?”</p><p>“I said I shan’t throw it away.”</p><p>“No, no! Something about permission. Permission? Whose permission? You said a name!”</p><p>“Are you referring to Master Shusei?”</p><p>“Yes, him! Tell me his full name! Who is he?!”</p><p>She was sure it must be the name of the man that the eunuchs had refused to tell her.</p><p>“My, you don’t know about Master Shu Shusei, even though you received permission directly from him? I’m astonished.”</p><p>“So his name is Master Shu Shusei? Tell me about him. Who is he?”</p><p>“He is an imperial appointee working for the Bureau of Sacrifices in the Ministry of Rites and a cuisinologist.”</p><p>“Cuisinologist? What’s that?”</p><p>“Cuisinology is a new field of science, which concerns food.”</p><p>“Food science?! There’s a science about food?! And Master Shusei is a scholar in it?!” Rimi’s voice did a triple jump out of surprise. The handmaid had seemed to surmise something from Rimi’s reaction and made a sardonic face.</p><p>“Master Shusei is treated as highly as a vice-minister of fourth rank. Not to mention, he has accompanied His Majesty in both his studies and play since they were young and advises him as grand councilor. His father, you see, is Chancellor Shu, who has served the Imperial Court since the previous emperor, and Master Shusei is set to become Chancellor one day himself. It does not matter how much you plead—he is not a man that someone of your status can associate with.”</p><p>“He advises His Majesty? Yet he’s a cuisinologist?”</p><p>“Master Shusei stubbornly professes to have no interest in politics and instead wishes to pursue his research in cuisinology. However, most believe that His Majesty plans to promote him to chancellor at some point.”</p><p><em>So he’s a very high-ranking individual... but I still want to see him...</em> Rimi thought, as if to cherish the small light that had lit up in her chest.<br/><br/></p><p><em>Master Shu Shusei, a cuisinologist...</em> It was late at night, and Rimi was heading to the kitchen holding a candlestick in her hand while thinking about Shusei. She put some kaorizuke in her mouth and felt her sense of taste returning ever so slightly. If she continued eating kaorizuke every day like this, she was sure that her sense of taste would be back before long. So, she needed to make even more.</p><p>When she reached the kitchen, it was already too late in the day, so not a single person was present, nor any fire lit. As she peeked through the entrance to decide what to do, she heard a man’s high-pitched voice behind her.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>She turned around to find the eunuch in charge of the kitchen. The eunuch brought his candlestick closer to Rimi to get a better look at her face and made a startled expression. </p><p>When Rimi asked to have some of the kitchen’s vegetables, the eunuch, seemingly not having the patience to lecture her, simply shrugged his shoulders and said, “Here you go, take however much you need,” and went off. Having received permission, Rimi stepped onto the cool earthen floor of the kitchen.<br/><br/></p><p>Near the back of the kitchen, there was a bamboo basket big enough to fit a person, containing vegetables. She walked toward it, lighting her way with her candle. She then placed the candlestick on a candle holder carved out from a pillar and removed the bamboo basket’s lid.</p><p>She dove into the basket, rummaging through the vegetables. She was hoping to find a spring melon—a small, jade-colored melon, which was perfect for pickling. With nothing to guide her in the darkness but her sense of touch, she dug through the bamboo basket and managed to find three spring melons. As she continued her search, she suddenly grabbed something soft and fluffy.</p><p><em>Soft? Fluffy...?</em></p><p>Wondering what kind of vegetable could have this strange texture, she pulled it out. It turned out to be an animal, small enough to fit in two hands. It was long, furry, had four legs, and a long tail. Its ears were small and pointed, and between them were two small, hard bumps.</p><p><em>This doesn’t look like any vegetable I’ve ever seen. Is this some kind of... long mouse?</em></p><p>She had seen pictures of foreign, long dogs before. But this animal was awfully small to be a dog. It was long-haired with silver fur. Considering it was going through the vegetables, it must have been some kind of rare Konkokuan mouse, she reasoned.</p><p>She tried petting it on its soft back, and as she did, it let out a small squeak and opened its eyes. It blinked its round, blue eyes a few times, before looking up at Rimi. Rimi’s heart skipped a beat at the mouse’s adorable eyes. It seemed very weak and did not even attempt to escape Rimi’s hands. The way it looked around restlessly with its round eyes made it seem all the more helpless and endearing.</p><p><em>It’s so cute... maybe I’ll just keep it.</em> She wanted to nurse it back to health and then set it free once it was feeling well again. Taking care of a mouse this cute would give her life here some meaning again, she felt.</p><p>Compared to the irises and peonies that were the high-ranking consorts, Rimi was but a wild flower, brought to the rear palace from a foreign country far away. A single, lonely, helpless foreign flower who had been sent here all by herself. There were no flowers here that bloomed with the same color as her. However, even a lonely flower blooming in the wild should be able to find a way to entertain herself. After all, she was fated to stay in this rear palace for the rest of her life, never to return to her home country again.</p><p>Carrying the silver mouse in her arms, Rimi cheerfully left the kitchen.</p><h2>II</h2><p>“I heard, Your Majesty.” </p><p>Ryu Shohi, the emperor of Konkoku, was polishing his sword on top of a decorative lacquerware bed. As he was doing so, a man had stepped into his bedchamber. It was none other than the cuisinology scholar Shu Shusei, who had spoken to Shohi in a somewhat reproachful tone.</p><p>Shifting his gaze from the blade, in which he could see the reflection of candle flames, Shohi answered in an annoyed voice. “And what exactly do you suppose you heard?”</p><p>“You terrorized one of the consorts of the rear palace, did you not? Is that why you’re here now, all alone in your bedchamber?” Shusei said.</p><p>“I terrorized no one. That simpleton was running her mouth about a foreigner in the rear palace, so I simply taught her a lesson,” Shohi stated simply.</p><p>“You mean you stood up for that foreign princess? Now that’s unexpected,” Shusei commented in surprise.</p><p>“I did not stand up for her. That simpleton angered me for attempting to instigate conflict in the rear palace, that is all,” Shohi offered begrudgingly.</p><p>“Simpleton, you say... that simpleton you speak of is your wife, you know,” Shusei sighed. As he did, someone’s laughter could be heard in the room.</p><p>“Oh, come on, Shusei. Nothing wrong with calling a simpleton a simpleton.” Sitting carelessly with one leg on the window sill was Shin Jotetsu.</p><p>“I heard about you too, Jotetsu. You offered to help His Majesty with cutting off the tongue of Noble Consort So, I’m told,” Shusei added.</p><p>“I’m hurt! Who do you take me for? I was just trying to stop His Majesty,” Jotetsu pouted. </p><p>“By cutting off Noble Consort So’s tongue?”</p><p>“I knew that if I offered to do it instead, he’d lose interest,” Jotetsu said.</p><p>“I swear, the both of you... I’m getting a headache,” Shusei grumbled.</p><img src="https://d2dq7ifhe7bu0f.cloudfront.net/Part-603407d52326b2fe13fe3ae6/insert2.jpg" /><p>Much like Shusei, Jotetsu had also been serving Shohi since he was young. He was now an imperial guard with the rank of junior officer. However, as a military officer appointed by imperial decree, he did not work with any organization, instead serving as Shohi’s bodyguard at all times.</p><p>Jotetsu had been Shohi’s bodyguard since Shohi was only seven, as arranged by the previous emperor and Chancellor Shu. Neither Shohi nor Shusei knew where he came from, but despite being only fourteen or fifteen years of age at the time, he showed impressive skill, and it was clear that he was no ordinary person. And with the previous emperor gone, the only people alive who knew of Jotetsu’s background were Chancellor Shu and Jotetsu himself.</p><p>Jotetsu had an official position now, but having grown up being watchful of his surroundings and serving as Shohi’s bodyguard, his disposition was more that of Shohi’s spy. Having been close for many years, Jotetsu would speak his mind to Shohi in a frank manner. He could not help but be a bad influence on him. It seemed Jotetsu had no intention of letting Shohi behave like an emperor.</p><p><em>Now, this is a problem... is His Majesty still too young to have an interest in women?</em> Shusei thought, but then grew worried as he reflected on himself. He was already twenty years of age, and the people in his vicinity had started bothering him about finding a wife, but he himself had no interest. Shusei had never had any romantic feelings for anyone to begin with, be it a woman or a man.</p><p><em>I just hope His Majesty isn’t like me in this regard. He has a duty to produce an heir.</em> Shusei suddenly lifted his head. <em>Might there exist a food that makes you keener on romance?</em></p><p>He was vaguely aware of the fact that this kind of thinking was exactly why he was not cut out for romance. However, simply being aware of it did not change who he was, and he would still fail to take note of women’s advances. If a beautiful woman were to dance half-naked in front of him, he would first take note of the workings of the dance itself, and only much later would any carnal desires surface. The gastronomer was known around the palace as the “Loveless Scholar.”</p><p>“And Your Majesty, you mustn’t neglect your supper.” He turned his gaze to the drink and the dim sum placed on the table.</p><p>“I do not want it. Have them take it away.”</p><p>“This food is important for your mind and body. I chose it personally. Please, eat up.”</p><p>Hearing Shusei’s stern tone, Shohi put his sword down by the bed, and reluctantly sat by the table. He picked up a pair of chopsticks as Shusei continued speaking matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Tomorrow I will prepare food that will stimulate your libido.”</p><p>Jotetsu burst into laughter, and Shohi choked on his food upon hearing this. Shohi reached toward his drink and hurriedly gulped it down, then turned to glare at Shusei.</p><p>“Where did that come from?”</p><p>“With a stronger libido, I’m sure you will find yourself wanting to visit even those women you refer to as simpletons.”</p><p>“Now that’s a stroke of genius, Shusei!” Jotetsu was laughing so hard he could barely speak. Shohi had an irritated look on his face.</p><p>“Absolutely not! How are you able to say something so embarrassing with a straight face?”</p><p>“Embarrassing, you say? It’s simply one of the many needs of humans, much like the need to eat and sleep.” Shusei was unable to understand why this topic would make someone embarrassed.</p><p>“All right, I get it, just stop already. Anyway, I do not want it. Besides, it seems rather unlikely that food like that exists.”</p><p>“It does. I just tested it myself recently. It’s decently effective.”</p><p>“Well, upon eating it, did you find yourself sneaking into the bedroom of some woman, Sir Loveless?”</p><p>“I did not. I was unable to think of a woman to visit, and finding a new one to woo seemed like too much effort. So instead, I spent the whole night channeling the energy into my writings.”</p><p>Jotetsu was desperately trying to stifle his laughter as he listened in on Shusei and Shohi’s conversation.</p><p>“Then I too shall simply spend the time writing,” Shohi concluded.</p><p>“Now, never mind that. Shusei, have you located it yet?” he continued while picking at his dim sum with his chopsticks. He had done his best to act as though this matter hadn’t been bothering him, but in truth, it had been on his mind ever since he ascended to the throne. And for good reason.</p><p>Jotetsu, who until now had been unable to contain his laughter, suddenly showed a composed, but hopeful, look in his eyes. However, Shusei had no information that could ease Shohi’s mind and could do nothing but shake his head.</p><p>“We have nothing to go on.”</p><p>“I see...” Shohi replied with a disappointed voice.</p><p>“Oh well, it wasn’t gonna be that easy. Don’t lose hope yet, Your Majesty. I’m sure we’ll find it sooner or later.”</p><p>Shohi nodded at Jotetsu’s casual remark as he picked up a very spicy sauce known as xinciyou and put it on the dim sum. Shusei called out in astonishment, “Your Majesty!” But Shohi ignored him, put the dim sum in his mouth, and started chewing.</p><p>“Is that not too spicy, Your Majesty?”</p><p>“Without this, it does not taste like anything.”<br/><br/></p><p class="centerp">🏶<br/><br/></p><p>“Oh, you’re so cute, Tama,” Rimi observed as the silver mouse was nibbling at some kaorizuke on her table. Over the past month, since Rimi found it in the kitchen, the mouse had firmly established its position as Rimi’s beloved pet.</p><p>She had asked the eunuch in charge of the kitchen, “I found a silver mouse in the kitchen. Can I keep it?” </p><p>The eunuch had replied, “Do whatever you want. I don’t care if it’s a mouse, an ant, a frog, or something else.” So Rimi had done just that.</p><p>Tama’s limbs were small and delicate, like a tiny bird’s. Each foot had five small claws. The claws on its front right foot were curled down, seemingly holding something akin to small pearl beads. It was as if the beads had just happened to become stuck under the claws as Tama had grown, and it did not seem possible to remove them. Rimi had named the mouse “Tama,” meaning “bead” in her own language.</p><p>On the table was, in addition to the plate that Tama was eating from, a celadon plate with a jiggling substance on top. It was a translucent, gelatinous substance, cut up into bite-sized pieces, with small, green beans visible inside. The translucent green fondly reminded her of spring. This translucent substance was actually a Wakokuan dish called hiyanimizore, made from nikogori—fish boiled whole until it turned into this gelatinous substance.</p><p>Rimi put a piece in her mouth. She could feel the taste of fish and ginger on her tongue as it melted in her mouth. As she lightly bit down, the refreshing spring beans easily crumbled, providing an interesting mouthfeel.</p><p>Her sense of taste had still not returned fully. Whenever she ate kaorizuke, her taste buds would revive for just a few hours. So, she had eaten a piece of kaorizuke and made the hiyanimizore during the short time that she could still taste. Rimi had also noticed that, for whatever reason, she was able to taste Wakokuan food without having kaorizuke first. Thus, at the very least, she could enjoy her own cooking without issue.</p><p>When Rimi came here, she had been assigned to one of the services in the rear palace. Each day, she was expected to show up at her station at the right time and perform the duties she had been assigned. However, she was still not used to her work, and it took most of her concentration to simply learn what to do. The others would consider her a nuisance, and it was not unusual for her to be back at the Small Wing Palace by the afternoon.</p><p>After having been sent home with a “You waste of space!” Rimi was enjoying her afternoon drinking tea with Tama. Having frequented the kitchen ever since she first came to the rear palace, she was on good terms with the servant women and the eunuch working there. As a result, she was able to ask the kitchen staff for ingredients, which she would use to make simple dishes for herself. The Wakokuan food had made Tama healthy again. Tama would often eat Rimi’s kaorizuke, and the more she ate, the healthier she became. </p><p>Right then, Rimi saw several palace women walking down the cloister. They seemed to be discussing something, and as they passed by Rimi’s residence, they started speaking loudly.</p><p>“My, the air around here feels awfully stagnant.”</p><p>“I can sense something barbaric nearby.”</p><p>“Oh, how frightening. Let’s be on our way, quickly.”</p><p><em>Same as ever, huh...</em></p><p>Emperor Shohi had warned Noble Consort So not to cause any conflict, but it’d had the opposite effect. So was now blaming Rimi for having incurred the wrath of the emperor. Her animosity had inevitably spread throughout the rear palace, and before long the whole rear palace seemed to have turned against her.</p><p>However, on occasion, she would also hear people whisper comments such as, “But for some reason, her skin is so beautiful,” or “As ugly as Setsu Rimi must be behind that façade, I can’t stand how beautiful her skin is.”</p><p>When it came to Rimi’s skin, there was more than genetics at play. For years, she had regularly eaten food that was good for her skin. That included the kaorizuke and also the hiyanimizore in front of her. As her Saigu sister had been fixated on food that was good for your skin, Rimi would make such food on an almost daily basis. The leftovers she would eat herself.</p><p>Rimi was currently unable to taste anything without eating kaorizuke first. She was also constantly having trouble at work. She was always stressed when heading there, which only led to more mistakes. The kaorizuke had become an important way to relieve her of all that stress, and so in search of more ingredients for it, she headed to the kitchen as usual once it had become dark. Being on friendly terms with the kitchen staff, she had been permitted to use the ingredients and kitchen equipment as she pleased.</p><p><em>I could go for some fish kaorizuke. If you fry the skin first, you can feel a sweet aroma in your mouth as you eat it, and it has a wonderfully smooth, savory taste. And the meat is succulent too. I just hope they have white fish. But first things first, I need to find the usual spring melon.</em></p><p>She entered the kitchen, candlestick in hand, to find the ingredients she needed. As she did, something startled her, and she stopped in her tracks.</p><p><em>Someone’s there!</em></p><p>In the corner of the dark kitchen was a small table and chair, which kitchen staff would usually use when eating during breaks, but now someone was resting there, with their head on the table. Based on his outfit, Rimi surmised that he was a eunuch. The eunuch did not move a finger as Rimi entered, and Rimi cautiously moved closer.</p><p>“Um... excuse me, are you a corpse?” She meant to ask if the eunuch was alive and feeling well. In response, the would-be corpse of a eunuch started laughing, his face still turned down.</p><p>“No, I’m no corpse. Not yet, at least,” he spoke in a soft voice and wearily looked up, brushing hair away from his face.</p><p><em>Wow... who is this person?</em> She observed the eunuch, wide-eyed. <em>He’s... captivating...</em></p><h2>III</h2><p>Rimi had first learned about eunuchs when she arrived in Konkoku. In Wakoku, there had been none. Eunuchs were men who had had their male functions removed in order to be allowed to work in the rear palace. As a result, their bodies ended up slender, their skin fair, and their voices high compared to other men. Neither fully male nor female, they had a curious air about them.</p><p>However, “curious” was not even close to describing the eunuch who was now sitting in front of her, lit by the candlelight.</p><p><em>He’s almost like a beautiful spirit...</em></p><p>Though he was sitting, Rimi surmised from the length of his arms and legs that he must have been rather tall. His skin was as pale as silk soaked in cold water, his eyes and hair a light brown, which overall gave a very colorless impression. He possessed a sweet, captivating beauty, more alluring than any concubine in the rear palace.</p><p>However, his expression was lifeless, and he seemed exceedingly tired and listless. His beauty had initially left Rimi speechless, but noticing his listlessness, she furrowed her brows.</p><p>“Um... are you not feeling well? You don’t look like a person who would be here this late.”</p><p>The shenyi he was wearing was made out of dark silk, and its quality was obvious from its luster.</p><p>“Right back at you. You’re a palace woman, right? You don’t look like someone who belongs in a kitchen.”</p><p>“I have permission. But that’s not the point. You’re not feeling well, are you? I will go get someone.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about me, I’m always like this. I just happened to forget to have supper today, you see, and I figured I’d better eat <em>something</em> at least. So I stopped by the first kitchen I came across, but there was no one here. I don’t really have much of an appetite to begin with, so I was just resting here.”</p><p><em>No appetite?</em> The moment she heard that, Rimi replied, “I will make something.”</p><p>The eunuch became wide-eyed at Rimi’s reflexive response.</p><p>“Make something? Food, you mean? <em>You</em> will?”</p><p>“That’s right,” she nodded and immediately went to inspect the stove. A small flame was still smoldering in the stove. It would be possible to make something simple with this, Rimi thought.</p><p><em>That’s right, I already have my hiyanimizore.</em></p><p>She walked to the stone room in the back of the kitchen used to refrigerate food and took out the nikogori dish—hiyanimizore. She then put it in a pot and lit the stove. She also brought the melon kaorizuke, which had been sitting next to the hiyanimizore, and chopped it up. She took a bite of the finely chopped kaorizuke and felt a gentle aroma in her mouth as her tastebuds revived.  She couldn’t very well make food without a working tongue.</p><p><em>He doesn’t seem to be feeling well, so I need to make something that’s easy to eat.</em> She was suddenly excited at this unexpected opportunity to cook for someone. The eunuch seemed surprised at Rimi, who had started to run around the kitchen out of nowhere.</p><p>“Are you, a palace woman, seriously going to make some food? It’s fine, you don’t have to bother. I’m not really in the mood to eat anyway.”</p><p>“Someone who entered a kitchen searching for food isn’t in the mood to eat? That’s not very convincing. Don’t worry, I <em>want</em> to make it. You can just sit there and shut your damn mouth if you will.”</p><p>The beautiful eunuch was stunned for a moment, then gave Rimi a confused look.</p><p>“You’re not from Konkoku, are you? Which would make you... that Wakokuan princess, Setsu Rimi, I take it. Rimi, who taught you Konkokuan?”</p><p>“An interpreter from Wakoku. He was originally a sailor who would sail between Konkoku and Wakoku.”</p><p>“I see, that explains it. ‘Shut your damn mouth if you will,’ eh?”</p><p>The nikogori in the pot had started to melt from the heat. She had made this hiyanimizore from freshwater fish. To remove any odor, she had added ginger and spring onion, let it simmer, and painstakingly removed all the scum. As a result, it had turned into a clear and fine liquid with no seasoning needed besides salt. To add some texture and sweetness, and to make it look more impressive, she had also added beans harvested in spring.</p><p>She was now in the process of reheating the hiyanimizore and melting it. As she brought it to a simmer, it turned into a soup with beans floating on top. She then added some of what appeared to be leftovers from today’s supper: a few thin, square sheets made from wheat, apparently called wonton.</p><p>Wonton literally means “cloud drink,” and just as its name implies, if you put it in a liquid and heat it, it turns soft and white like a cloud, going down as smoothly as a drink. The wonton also made the soup more viscous.</p><p>She was almost done. To make the flavor a bit richer, she added a popular Konkokuan sauce called ganjiang.</p><p>“Here, have a taste.” Rimi poured the finished soup into a bowl and presented it to the eunuch alongside a small plate of kaorizuke. She took a seat on the opposite side of him.</p><p>The eunuch seemed confused for a second, but soon picked up a spoon and put a spoonful of soup in his mouth. He continued in silence, drinking one spoonful after another. <em>The combination of the high-quality fish stock and the slightly sweet ganjiang should have resulted in a gentle-tasting dish, and the texture provided by the wonton should make it go down easily,</em> Rimi thought.</p><p><em>I hope he likes it.</em> The sight of him bringing the spoon to his mouth was somehow sensual. <em>I guess even someone as beautiful as him has to eat food. What a relief.</em> She was relieved at the fact that, despite how beautiful he was, he was no god nor spirit, eating food just like any other human would.</p><p>The eunuch put down his spoon, picked up a pair of chopsticks instead, and put a piece of kaorizuke in his mouth. “What’s this? It’s sweet.”</p><p>“It’s a dish from Wakoku. It’s called kaorizuke. It’s sweet, but it has no sugar. And if you eat a lot of it, you will become healthier. It’s good for your skin.”</p><p>“It’s my first time trying Wakokuan food. I like it.”</p><p>He picked up the spoon again. After Rimi had observed his captivating mouth as he ate the soup for a while, he suddenly stopped. The bowl of soup was empty. He exhaled a breath of warm air, and a hint of color seemed to have returned to his previously pale cheeks. Rimi could tell without asking that he was content with the meal, and she felt a mix of relief and happiness.</p><p>“Are you always feeling unwell like this?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say I’m feeling unwell. I just didn’t really have an appetite and my stomach felt bloated.”</p><p>Just as Rimi had lost her sense of taste after coming to the rear palace, she thought that perhaps this beautiful eunuch also had something weighing on his mind. But having finished the soup, he had a considerably softer air to him than before. She was amazed at how much someone’s demeanor could change after a single bowl of soup. <em>If he continues eating good-tasting food like this every day, then perhaps whatever is eating at him will abate, and he’ll regain his appetite,</em> she thought. His change made her happy.</p><p>“I would gladly make this for you anytime you like. Just let me know.”</p><p>“Now that’s an extraordinary thing to say.”</p><p>“Extraordinary, is it?”</p><p>“It’s very extraordinary indeed. I’ll have to thank you somehow. Is there anything you’d like?”</p><p>“Not really. I would be happy if you just came to get me whenever you want something to eat.”</p><p>The eunuch looked at Rimi as if he was observing an unusual animal. He then burst out laughing. It was beautiful laughter.</p><p>“Well, aren’t you cute. All right, fine. But if you ever need something in the future, I’ll fulfill any request you have.”</p><p>“Any request...? Um... who are you, exactly?” The eunuch had spoken with such confidence that Rimi had become curious. He must have been a tremendously high-ranking eunuch to be able to exercise his power as he pleased.</p><p>“Me?” The eunuch had smiled mischievously, leaned toward Rimi across the table, and whispered seductively into her ear, “That’s a secret.”</p><p>Rimi let out a quick shriek and bent backward, and at the sight of her reaction, the eunuch widened his smile. He then stood up from his chair and left the kitchen, fading into the dark of night.</p><p>Rimi held onto the earlobe that the eunuch’s breath had touched. It felt ticklish, as if a butterfly had landed on her ear. He had been too alluring, too captivating for Rimi to handle.<br/><br/></p><p>However, that was the last Rimi saw of the beautiful eunuch. She worried about his health. He was probably failing to eat properly, just like on the night they met.</p><p><em>I wish he’d come by for something to eat,</em> she would think as she stopped by the kitchen almost nightly.</p><p>Like most other nights, she had just come back to her residence after searching the kitchen for food. She left the spring melon she had brought back in her living room and made for the dark bedroom. It was a dark, moonless night. She placed a faintly burning candle next to her bed and was about to undo her sash when she noticed something was off.</p><p><em>Wait, where’s Tama?</em> Usually, Tama would be sleeping bundled up on her bed, but now the mouse was nowhere to be found. Perhaps she was hiding somewhere, but the only time Tama would usually hide was when there were people other than Rimi in the room.</p><p>“No, surely not...” The moment she uttered those words, she could sense a chilling presence approaching from the darkness behind her. She attempted to turn around, but before she had a chance, two large hands grabbed her shoulders.</p><p>“Heya, miss palace woman. Nice evening we’ve got here, huh?”</p><p>Her body tensed up at the sound of the deep, male voice. This was the rear palace, where no men other than eunuchs were allowed, yet the man behind her was clearly no eunuch. She could tell that he was well-built, masculine, and intimidating.</p><p>“Wh-Who’s there?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter who I am. I’ve got a little favor to ask of you. Would you mind handing over your most valued belonging?”</p><p>Rimi’s mind immediately went to her pot of kaoridoko, used to make kaorizuke. Everything else she owned had been brought in by others when she first joined the rear palace. The only special item that Rimi owned was the kaoridoko.</p><p>“N-No. Anything but that.”</p><p>“Now, now, be a good girl, and nothing bad will happen. But if you’re not a good girl, I might just have to do something to you. Gotta say, miss palace woman, that’s a mighty slim neck you’ve got there. Looks like I could break it with just one hand.” He lightly grabbed Rimi’s neck with one hand. The sensation of the man’s cold, hard hand immediately filled her with dread. Her eyes tearing up, she had no choice but to nod.</p><p>“That’s a good girl. Now, show me where it is. And don’t make a scene.”</p><p>Rimi slowly walked to the side of her bed and picked up the pot as the man watched dubiously.</p><p>“It’s in there, is it?”</p><p>The man softly shoved Rimi from behind, and she stumbled. Before Rimi knew it, the man was in front of her and had already taken her pot. Looking up from the floor, she could faintly make out the man’s figure. She couldn’t see his face, but his robust, muscular body, and the wide sword hanging from his waist, were terrifying enough.</p><p>“Forget this ever happened. As long as I have this, we’re good.”</p><p>“But... why? Why do you want that? Who are you?”</p><p>“No prying. And don’t go mentioning this to anyone else, got it? Otherwise, I’m gonna have to come and shut you up myself, Setsu Rimi,” the man finished before silently leaving the room and disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>The sight of him leaving was so vivid that Rimi doubted her eyes for a moment, sitting dumbfounded on the floor. Before long, tears started to run down her cheeks.</p><p>“My kaoridoko...”</p><p>Without it, she could not make kaorizuke. And without kaorizuke, she would never get her sense of taste back. Without her sense of taste, she wouldn’t be able to make hiyanimizore. Even if that pale-looking eunuch came by again, she wouldn’t be able to cook for him. At this rate, she would lose not only her sense of taste but her cooking too. That man had more or less stolen Rimi’s only skill. Struck by grief at the loss of her kaoridoko, she was too shaken to even think about who that man was, or why he wanted her kaoridoko.</p><p>As she sat on the floor, one tear after another falling on her skirt, she heard a small squeaking noise from under the bed, and Tama appeared. Tama jumped up on her shoulder and started cooing into her ear, almost as if trying to comfort her. However, her tears would not stop.</p><p><em>Tell me, what should I do, Lady Saigu?</em></p><p>The pillar that supported Rimi had suddenly been demolished.</p></body></html>
